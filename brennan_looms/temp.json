His work is in major art museums around the world and he has taught and lectured at universities and art schools since 1962.He began a 7 year full-time tapestry apprenticeship in 1948 at the Dovecot in Edinburgh,Scotland.",
    "archie_quote": "\u201cIt is more than twenty years since I first designed and offered, free, for personal use only, this design for a basic copper tapestry loom with warp tension adjustment and possibilities for many developments. It was an inexpensive loom for beginners, for test weaving and small works. A number of copies- with questionable improvements are now being marketed elsewhere.\u201d - Archie Brennan",
    "about_jesse": "Jesse, Archie\u2019s Son, grew up in Hawaii and spent the majority of his youth in the studio surrounded by weaving. One of his earliest memories is cutting the warp of a nearly finished tapestry while his dad has his back turned. Although he is not a weaver per se, it is safe to say he has spent more time near looms than most people. Jesse has picked up the thread his father started, taking up the craft of loom building.\r\n\r\nJesse studied Urban Planning a the University of Oregon. He currently lives and works in Portland, Oregon.",
